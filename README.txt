The solution is very large in size so it is hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/Yusuf5041/SurvivalGame.git

The solution is contained in two folders:

FinalBuild:

	This folder is over 300MB which required it to be hosted elsewhere

	Download this folder from: https://qmulprod-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ec16402_qmul_ac_uk/El4j2AecJWZOnGts1LpyabQBhx8D3WUGEjV5X2nVk8Z-6w?e=Sq281l

	This contains the executable file. Open the application file called 'experimentation'

	Please ensure you have a mouse and keyboard to use the solution (play the game).

Scripts:
	This folder contains the scripts I created myself for the solution

HealthUp:

	Downloaded from: https://github.com/Yusuf5041/SurvivalGame.git

	This repository contains the entire Unity project, the scripts can be viewed without Unity, however if you want to view the entire project Unity must be installed.

	You can install Unity at: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download 

	For scripts in other assets and libraries:
	look in any of the other folders in Assets and find a Script(s) folder within them
